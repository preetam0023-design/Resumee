    <p2>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), also known as the panda bear or simply panda, is a bear species endemic to China. It is characterised by its white coat with black patches around the eyes, ears, legs and shoulders. Its body is rotund; adult individuals weigh 100 to 115 kg (220 to 254 lb) and are typically 1.2 to 1.9 m (3 ft 11 in to 6 ft 3 in) long. It is sexually dimorphic, with males being typically 10 to 20% larger than females. A thumb is visible on its forepaw, which helps in holding bamboo in place for feeding. It has large molar teeth and expanded temporal fossa to meet its dietary requirements. It can digest starch and is mostly herbivorous with a diet consisting almost entirely of bamboo and bamboo shoots.</p2>

<p3>The giant panda lives exclusively in six montane regions in a few Chinese provinces at elevations of up to 3,000 m (9,800 ft). It is solitary and gathers only in mating seasons. It relies on olfactory communication to communicate and uses scent marks as chemical cues and on landmarks like rocks or trees. Females rear cubs for an average of 18 to 24 months. The oldest known giant panda was 38 years old.</p3>

<h2>Etymology</h2>
<hr>
<p4>The word panda was borrowed into English from French, but no conclusive explanation of the origin of the French word panda has been found.<sup>[4]</sup> The closest candidate is the Nepali word ponya, possibly referring to the adapted wrist bone of the red panda, which is native to Nepal. In many older sources, the name "panda" or "common panda" refers to the red panda (Ailurus fulgens),[5] which was described some 40 years earlier and over that period was the only animal known as a panda.[6] The binomial name Ailuropoda melanoleuca means black and white (melanoleuca) cat-foot (ailuropoda).[7]</p4>
<br> <br>
<p>In Taiwan, another popular name for panda is the inverted dàmāoxióng (大貓熊; lit. 'giant cat bear'), though many encyclopedias and dictionaries in Taiwan still use the "bear cat" form as the correct name. Some linguists argue, in this construction, "bear" instead of "cat" is the base noun, making the name more grammatically and logically correct, which have led to the popular choice despite official writings. <sup>[9]</sup> This name did not gain its popularity until 1988, when a private zoo in Tainan painted a sun bear black and white and created the Tainan fake panda incident. <sup>[10][11]</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<hr>
<p>For many decades, the precise taxonomic classification of the giant panda was under debate because it shares characteristics with both bears and raccoons.[12] In 1985, molecular studies indicated that the giant panda is a true bear, part of the family Ursidae.[13][14] These studies show it diverged about 19 million years ago from the common ancestor of the Ursidae;[15] it is the most basal member of this family and equidistant from all other extant bear species. <sup>[15][16]</sup></p>
<br><br>
<strong>Subspecies</strong>
<ul>
<li>Two subspecies of giant panda have been recognized on the basis of distinct cranial measurements, colour patterns, and population genetics. <sup>[17]</sup></li>
<li>A detailed study of the giant panda's genetic history from 2012 confirms that the separation of the Qinling population occurred about 300,000 years ago, and reveals that the non-Qinling population further diverged into two groups, named the Minshan and the Qionglai-Daxiangling-Xiaoxiangling-Liangshan group respectively, about 2,800 years ago. <sup>[21]</sup></li>

</ul>
<h3>Phylogeny</h3>
<p>Of the eight extant species in the bear family Ursidae, the giant panda's lineage branched off the earliest. <sup>[22][23]</sup></p>
